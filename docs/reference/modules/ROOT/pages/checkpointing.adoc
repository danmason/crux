= Checkpointing

Crux nodes can save checkpoints of their query indices on a regular basis, so that new nodes can start to service queries faster.

Crux nodes that join a cluster have to obtain a local set of query indices before they can service queries.
These can be built by replaying the transaction log from the beginning, although this may be slow for clusters with a lot of history.
Checkpointing allows the nodes in a cluster to share checkpoints into a central 'checkpoint store', so that nodes joining a cluster can retrieve a recent checkpoint of the query indices, rather than replaying the whole history.

The checkpoint store is a pluggable module - AWS's xref::s3.adoc#checkpoint-store[S3] is the first officially-supported implementation.

Crux nodes in a cluster don't explicitly communicate regarding which one is responsible for creating a checkpoint - instead, they check at random intervals to see whether any other node has recently created a checkpoint, and create one if necessary.
The desired frequency of checkpoints can be set using `approx-frequency`.

== Setting up

You can enable checkpoints on your index-store by adding a `:checkpointer` dependency to the underlying KV store:

== Checkpointer parameters

* `approx-frequency` (required, `Duration`): approximate frequency for the _cluster_ to save checkpoints
* `store`: (required, `CheckpointStore`): see the individual store for more details.
* `checkpoint-dir` (string/`File`/`Path`): temporary directory to store checkpoints in before they're uploaded
* `keep-dir-between-checkpoints?` (boolean, default true): whether to keep the temporary checkpoint directory between checkpoints
* `keep-dir-on-close?` (boolean, default false): whether to keep the temporary checkpoint directory when the node shuts down
